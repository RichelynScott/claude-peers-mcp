## [Unreleased]

## [0.5.1] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **Broker handler refactor**: Separated 1342-line `broker.ts` monolith into `broker.ts` (524 lines, state/timers/lifecycle) + `broker-handlers.ts` (720 lines, request handlers in factory closures). Architecture validated by 5-model PAL consensus (GPT-5.3-codex, GPT-5.4, Sonnet 4.6, GLM-5, Minimax). (`1805548`)
- **SIGHUP code hot-reload**: SIGHUP now reloads handler code from disk via dynamic import cache-busting + `Bun.serve().reload()`, in addition to token/config refresh. Connections preserved, rollback on import failure. (`3af8ac2`)
- **BrokerContext pattern**: All handler state passed via typed `BrokerContext` object (db, 13 prepared statements, Maps, config refs). Enables unit-testable handlers with mock context. (`5b2019a`)
- **Auto-summary disambiguation**: TTY identifier included in summary prefix (`[CPM_WORKER_2:pts/44]`) so sessions in the same directory are distinguishable. Registration age shown in `list_peers` output (`Active: 2h 15m`). MCP instructions updated to emphasize frequent, specific `set_summary` calls. (`b9d9382`)
- **Immediate summary on set_name**: Calling `set_name` now auto-regenerates and pushes the summary with the new name. New sessions with a name get a fallback summary (`[Name] Awaiting tasks in project`) instead of nothing. (`b9d9382`)

### Fixed
- **Dead route**: Removed duplicate POST `/federation/status` case (unreachable — federation status is GET-only, handled before POST auth check).

## [0.5.0] - 2026-03-26 — Stable Release

### Summary
Production-stable release after extensive reliability work, multi-model code review (GPT-5.4, Grok-4.20, Gemini-3.1-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2, Minimax-m2.7, Kimi-k2.5, GLM-5), and security audit. 104 tests, 318 assertions. Simplified delivery model, deterministic peer IDs, broker hot-reload, and comprehensive CLI tooling.

### Added
- End-to-end integration tests for full message delivery pipeline (4 new tests)
- Broker SIGHUP hot-reload for config/token changes without restart
- `reload-broker` CLI command sends SIGHUP to running broker
- Federation relay validation (type, metadata, size limit) matching local send rules

### Security
- Final PAL security review (Gemini-3.1-Pro) — no critical or high issues
- All 12 security checklist items verified (ack scoping, HMAC, timingSafeEqual, parameterized SQL, etc.)

## [0.4.2] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **SIGHUP hot-reload for broker config**: Broker re-reads auth token and persistent config file on SIGHUP without dropping connections or requiring `/mcp` reconnect. Uses `Bun.serve().reload()` to swap fetch handler in-place. (`e9af8f6`)
- **`reload-broker` CLI command**: Finds broker PID via lsof, sends SIGHUP, reports success with peer count. (`e9af8f6`)

### Fixed
- **Federation relay validation (security)**: Federation `/relay` endpoint now validates metadata is a plain object (not array), enforces 10KB combined size limit (text + metadata), and uses the shared `VALID_MESSAGE_TYPES` set — same rules as `/send-message`. Previously a malicious federated peer could relay oversized or malformed messages. (`9375f11`)
- **Zombie test broker cleanup**: All 4 test files now force-kill any process holding their test port in `beforeAll`, preventing cascading failures from interrupted test runs. (`b1b9bee`)

## [0.4.1] - 2026-03-26

### Changed
- **Simplified delivery model**: Stripped deferred ack system (-279 lines). Messages now push once, ack immediately, dedup via Set, with `check_messages` as fallback. Removed: pending buffers, delivery warnings, sender tracking, bug reports, piggyback inbox, retry push — all caused cascading problems (duplicates, spam, constant pinging).
- **Deterministic peer IDs**: Peer IDs are now SHA-256 hashes of TTY, stable across `/mcp` reconnects. Messages sent to an old ID still arrive after reconnect.
- **Per-poll peer fetch**: Sender info fetched once per poll cycle with `scope: "lan"` instead of per-message with `scope: "machine"`. Reduces broker load and includes federated senders.
- **Session identification improvements**: Session names persist locally in MCP server and re-sent on register. Auto-summaries include `[SessionName]` prefix when set. `list_peers` output shows session name as prominent header (`**Name** (id)`). (`37adc79`)

### Fixed
- **Duplicate message delivery**: Added permanent `pushedMessageIds` Set with bounded cap (1000). Messages are never pushed twice regardless of ack state or buffer expiry.
- **Delivery warning spam**: Removed entirely. Warnings fired every second instead of once, and the underlying push unreliability is a Claude Code limitation, not fixable server-side.
- **Ack scoping**: `/ack-messages` now scopes by `to_id` — peers can only ack their own messages.
- **Dead peer message bounce**: Broker bounces undelivered messages back to senders when target peer dies, with orphan cleanup on startup.
- **Dead code cleanup**: Removed all leftover references to removed systems (writeBugReport, SentMessage, FAILURE_LOG_PATH, etc.)
- **Stale tool descriptions**: Updated `check_messages` and `channel_health` descriptions to match simplified implementation.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Deferred ack for channel push reliability** — messages are no longer acked to the broker immediately after `mcp.notification()`. They enter a pending buffer and are only confirmed when evidence of receipt arrives: `check_messages` call, `reply_to` match, or 30s optimistic timeout. Eliminates ~30-50% silent message loss. (`0aef487`)
- **`check_messages` as a real fallback** — now returns pending (pushed but unconfirmed) messages plus new broker messages, deduplicated. Previously returned empty because messages were already acked. (`0aef487`)
- **Startup retry logic** — `/register` call wrapped in 3-attempt retry with exponential backoff (0ms, 1s, 3s) and 5s per-attempt timeout. Fixes "Failed to connect" errors with 6+ sessions. (`68dc1ac`)
- **Configurable startup timeout** — `CLAUDE_PEERS_STARTUP_TIMEOUT_MS` env var and `server.startup_timeout_ms` config (default 15s, min 3s clamp). (`68dc1ac`)
- **Startup timing instrumentation** — each startup phase timed and logged: `broker=Xms, token=Yms, register=Zms, total=Nms`. (`68dc1ac`)
- **Graceful startup error messages** — on final failure, probes `/health` for peer count, reports broker reachability, suggests actionable fix. (`68dc1ac`)
- **Enhanced `/health` endpoint** — returns `uptime_ms`, `requests_last_minute`, and `pending_messages` in addition to existing fields. (`68dc1ac`)
- **Broker request priority** — `/heartbeat` and `/poll-messages` yield to event loop before body parsing, letting queued `/register` requests run first. (`68dc1ac`)
- **`federation init`** — one-command setup: config file, certs, token, platform-specific firewall (WSL2/macOS/Linux), broker restart, outputs join URL. Replaces `federation setup` (which remains as alias). (`5c5b49e`)
- **`federation join <cpt-url>`** — single command to join a federation using a `cpt://host:port/token` URL. Writes token, updates config, generates cert, restarts broker, connects. (`5c5b49e`)
- **`federation token`** — generates a `cpt://` connection URL for sharing with other machines. (`5c5b49e`)
- **`federation doctor`** — comprehensive health check: config, token, certs, broker, TLS, LAN IP, connected remotes, config/actual mismatch warnings. (`5c5b49e`)
- **Auto-reconnect on broker restart** — broker reads `federation.remotes` from config file on startup and reconnects with exponential backoff (0s, 5s, 15s, 45s, then 60s). (`5c5b49e`)
- **Connect/disconnect persistence** — `federation connect` saves to config file, `federation disconnect` removes. Survives broker restarts. (`5c5b49e`)
- **`federation refresh-wsl2`** — updates stale port forwarding rules when WSL2 IP changes after reboot. (`54f3a6d`)
- **WSL2 mirrored networking detection** — reads `.wslconfig` for `networkingMode=mirrored`, skips port forwarding when detected. (`54f3a6d`)
- **mDNS auto-discovery** — new `src/mdns.ts` module with `MdnsManager`. Advertises `_claude-peers._tcp` service on LAN via `bonjour-service`. Auto-connects when matching PSK hash peers discovered. Backoff logic, dedup, WSL2 graceful degradation. (`1fddddf`)
- **Sender delivery confirmation** — broker `/message-status` endpoint, `message_status` MCP tool, automatic 30s delivery check with channel push warning to sender. (`1657928`)
- **Auto bug reports** — on send failure or unconfirmed delivery, writes diagnostics to `BUG_REPORTS/` and `cpm-logs/delivery-failures.log`. (`1657928`)
- **`channel_health` MCP tool** — diagnostic report: broker status, pending inbound/outbound, delivery warnings, recent failures, bug report count. (`1657928`)

### Fixed
- **`FEDERATION_ENABLED=false` env var override** — previously only checked for `true`/`1`, now respects `false`/`0` to explicitly disable federation even when config file says enabled. (`1122b72`)
- **Delivery warning surfacing** — warnings now push a self-notification via channel to interrupt the sender immediately, not just log to stderr. (`4f5546d`)
- **Better Windows LAN IP detection** — uses default route method (`Get-NetIPConfiguration` with gateway) instead of pattern matching that misses `172.16-31.*` and hits VPN adapters. (`54f3a6d`)
- **WSL2 subnet warning** — broker logs warning when user sets `CLAUDE_PEERS_FEDERATION_SUBNET` to non-`0.0.0.0/0` on WSL2 (unreliable due to NAT IP rewriting). (`54f3a6d`)

### Code Quality (7-model consensus review)
- 12 issues identified and fixed via multi-model consensus review (GPT-5.4, Grok-4.20, Gemini-3.1-Pro, DeepSeek-v3.2, Minimax-m2.7, Kimi-k2.5, GLM-5):
  - `sentMessages` Map bounded at MAX_SENT=200 (`server.ts`)
  - PSK hash comparison uses `timingSafeEqual` to prevent timing side-channel (`mdns.ts`)
  - `Peer.channel_push` made optional to prevent "undefined" display on remote peers (`types.ts`)
  - Config file permissions tightened to 0o600 (`config.ts`)
  - Bug report filename collision fixed for messageId=0 send failures (`server.ts`)
  - Warned `sentMessages` entries rechecked for late delivery (`server.ts`)
  - `as any` cast removed in message_status handler (`server.ts`)
  - Verification timer cleared on shutdown (`server.ts`)
  - `autoReconnectRemote` capped at 20 attempts and doubled backoff fixed (`broker.ts`)
  - Federation relay validates message type against allowed set (`broker.ts`)
  - Buffer overflow force-ack replaced with skip-and-re-poll to preserve deferred ack contract (`server.ts`)
  - MdnsManager `dedupMap`/`backoffMap` cleaned every 5 minutes (`mdns.ts`)
